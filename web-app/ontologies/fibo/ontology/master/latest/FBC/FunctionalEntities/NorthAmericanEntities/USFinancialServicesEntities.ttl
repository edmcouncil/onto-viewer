		"The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 defines a bank as any depository financial intermediary that accepts checking accounts (checks) or makes commercial loans, and its deposits are insured by a federal deposit insurance agency.  A bank acts as a middleman between suppliers of funds and users of funds, substituting its own credit judgement for that of the ultimate suppliers of funds, collecting those funds from three sources: checking accounts, savings and time deposits; short-term borrowings from other banks; and equity capital. A bank earns money by reinvesting these funds in longer-term assets."
