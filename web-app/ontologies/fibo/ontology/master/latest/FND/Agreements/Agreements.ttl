		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Agreements.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to revise a few of the definitions based on more formal sources.""" ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified per FIBO 2.0 RFC to add general concepts including obligor, obligee, and beneficiary in support of other FIBO domain areas." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/." ,
